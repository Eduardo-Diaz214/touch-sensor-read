# touch-sensor-read
Reading capacitive values with a touch sensor.

This project reads capacitive touch values from a touch pin on the ESP32 and prints them to the console.

## Requirements
- ESP32 board
- MicroPython firmware installed
- Touch sensor pad (or wire connected to touch pin)

## Pinout
- Touch sensor: GPIO 4

## How to Run
1. Upload `main.py` to your ESP32.
2. Open the MicroPython console.
3. Touch the pad connected to GPIO 4 and see the capacitive value change.
